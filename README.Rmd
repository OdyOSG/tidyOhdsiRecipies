The goal of tidyOhdsiRecipies is to simplify and automate routine tasks when working with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). This package provides a set of tools and functions to help researchers and analysts effectively manage, analyze and modify data that complies with the OMOP CDM standard.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidyOhdsiRecipies like so:

``` r
# install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('OdyOSG/tidyOhdsiRecipies')
```

## Example

Reading json cohorts representation to `CohortGenerator` definition set
and / or convert it to Darwin `CDMConnector` cohort set in case your are using `PhenotypeLibrary` package

```{r example}
library(tidyOhdsiRecipies)
# create cohortsToCreate for `CohortGenerator` package
# Case 1
cohortsToCreate <- tidyOhdsiRecipies::createCohortDefinitionSet(
  path = "inst/cohorts",
  computeAttrition = TRUE
)

### if you want to use Darwin
cohortSet <- cohortsToCreate2CDMConn(cohortsToCreate)
# Case 2
# You need to build 100 covariate cohorts from concept sets that have different domains and contain both standard and source codes.
caprConceptSets <- collectCaprCsFromCohort(returnTestDonorCohort())
cohorts <- purrr::map(
  caprConceptSets,
  ~ createCaprConceptSetCohort(
    conceptSet = .x,
    limit = "all",
    requiredObservation = c(1, 1),
    end = "fixed_exit",
    endArgs = list(
      index = c("startDate"),
      offsetDays = 1
    ),
    addSourceCriteria = TRUE
  )
)
## then you can deliver it to cohortsToCreate
cohortsToCreate <- createCohortDefinitionSet(
  cohorts = cohorts
)

```
